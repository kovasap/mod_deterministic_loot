# mod_deterministic_loot

Makes it so getting loot at the end of a battle is always deterministic; it does
not depend on random rolls.
Currently only works for weapon drops.

## Installing

Every commit to this repository will generate a GitHub release, from which you can download the mod_rng_free.zip file to place in your Battle Brothers data/ directory to install the mod.
